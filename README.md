# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction
DS 5220: Supervised Machine Learning Final Project

All results have been created on Google Colab.
To recreate results, just download the data and change the path at the begining. 
Plotly was used to generate interactive plots, but they couldn't be saved here at GitHub.

A zipped folder has been attached to the mail as well in case you want to recreate results.
